            <span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>2. REQUIREMENTS</strong></span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">In order for Company or any of its employees to use the Application, either Company or at least one company employee must be an AT&amp;T wireless subscriber, receive a bill from AT&amp;T, and sign up for the Service. A minimum of two users is required. Company employees with Apple&reg; iPhone&reg; Devices with operating systems of 3.1 or higher can download the Application Software and use the Application Software for setup, activation and management of the Service from their iPhone Devices. Company employees with select models of BlackBerry&reg; Devices can download the Application Software and use the Application Software to activate, setup, and to manage the Service from their BlackBerry Devices. Minimal data synchronization charges may apply when using the Application to place calls from iPhone and BlackBerry devices. Company employees with other Devices, both wireline and wireless, must manage the Service online through a web browser and cannot download the Application Software. Internet Access is not provided as part of the Service. It shall be Your responsibility to manage all configuration details. If Company is an AT&amp;T wireless subscriber, then as to Company employees that are AT&amp;T wireless subscribers, wireless airtime minutes used with the Application will decrement from Company&#39;s wireless voice plan, if Company pays for its employees&#39; wireless voice minutes, or from the employees&#39; own wireless voice plans, if the employees pay for their own wireless voice minutes. Data used with this Application, for faxes, emails and other services, will be deducted from Company&#39;s wireless data plan, if the company pays for its employees&#39; wireless data usage, or from the employees&#39; own wireless data plans, if the employees pay for their own wireless data usage. If Company does not subscribe to AT&amp;T wireless service, wireless airtime and data will be deducted from the employee&#39;s plan. If allotted airtime minutes or allotted data usage are exceeded, Company and/or its employees (as the case may be) will incur pay-per-use charges. Only the Responsible Subscriber (as defined in Section 6 below) can authorize the purchase and the use of the Application by Company employees.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">B) If You are a Company employee who obtains your wireless service from a provider other than AT&amp;T, You may still use the Application, but You need to check with Your wireless service provider for service plans and supported features. In this case, You must subscribe (either individually or through Company) to another service provider&#39;s wireless voice and data services to use the Application&#39;s mobile features. If You (or, if You are Company, Your employees) subscribe to another service provider besides AT&amp;T, You are responsible for determining if You incur airtime, data, or other charges with that service provider when using the Application. Under no circumstance will AT&amp;T be responsible for such charges. When You (or, if You are Company, Your employees) use a service provider other than AT&amp;T, it is Your sole responsibility, not AT&amp;T&#39;s to ensure that the other service provider will support all features of the Application, and to identify and acquire all required intellectual property licenses prior to installation or use, to determine when You will be charged, and to comply with the terms and conditions of the service provider.</span></p>
        <p>

        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY. IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS. </strong></span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>IF YOU ARE AN INDIVIDUAL OR CORPORATE OR BUSINESS AT&amp;T WIRELESS SERVICE SUBSCRIBER AND USE THE WIRELESS APPLICATION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR AT&amp;T WIRELESS SERVICE PLAN, THESE LICENSE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF YOUR APPLICABLE WIRELESS SERVICE AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME. IF YOU ARE A COMPANY EMPLOYEE AND YOU USE THE APPLICATION IN CONNECTION WITH YOUR COMPANY&#39;S AT&amp;T WIRELESS SERVICE PLAN, THESE LICENSE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS OF YOUR COMPANY&#39;S APPLICABLE WIRELESS SERVICE AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME. IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT NEITHER OF THE FOREGOING APPLIES (FOR EXAMPLE, IF YOU ARE USING THE APPLICATION IN CONNECTION WITH WIRELESS SERVICE FROM A PROVIDER OTHER THAN AT&amp;T , THESE LICENSE TERMS ARE SUBJECT TO THE ARBITRATION PROVISIONS WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THIS SECTION.</strong></span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;"><u>Summary:</u></span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to the customer&#39;s satisfaction by calling our customer service department at 1-800-331-0500. <strong>In the unlikely event that AT&amp;T&#39;s customer service department is unable to resolve a complaint You may have to Your satisfaction (or if AT&amp;T has not been able to resolve a dispute it has with You after attempting to do so informally), we each agree to resolve those disputes through binding arbitration or small claims court instead of in courts of general jurisdiction.</strong> Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, allows for more limited discovery than in court, and is subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award the same damages and relief that a court can award. Any arbitration under these License Terms will take place on an individual basis; class arbitrations and class actions are not permitted. For any non-frivolous claim that does not exceed $75,000, AT&amp;T will pay all costs of the arbitration. Moreover, in arbitration You are entitled to recover attorneys&#39; fees from AT&amp;T to at least the same extent as You would be in court.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">In addition, under certain circumstances (as explained below), AT&amp;T will pay You more than the amount of the arbitrator&#39;s award and will pay Your attorney (if any) twice his or her reasonable attorneys&#39; fees if the arbitrator awards You an amount that is greater than what AT&amp;T has offered You to settle the dispute.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;"><strong>23.1 Arbitration Agreement.</strong></span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1) AT&amp;T and You agree to arbitrate all disputes and claims between us. This agreement to arbitrate is intended to be broadly interpreted. It includes, but is not limited to:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us, whether based in contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal theory;</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that arose before these License Terms or any prior agreement (including, but not limited to, claims relating to advertising);</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which You are not a member of a certified class; and</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; claims that may arise after the termination of these License Terms.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">For purposes of this Section 23.1 only, references to &quot;AT&amp;T,&quot; &quot;You,&quot; &quot;Your&quot; and &quot;us&quot; include our respective subsidiaries, affiliates, agents, employees, predecessors in interest, successors, and assigns, as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of this Application, or of Devices under these License Terms or prior agreements between us. Notwithstanding the foregoing, either party may bring an individual action in small claims court. This arbitration agreement does not preclude You from bringing issues to the attention of federal, state, or local agencies, including, for example, the Federal Communications Commission. Such agencies can, if the law allows, seek relief against us on Your behalf. <strong>You agree that, by entering into these License Terms, You and AT&amp;T are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action.</strong> These License Terms evidence a transaction in interstate commerce, and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision. This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these License Terms.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">2) A party who intends to seek arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written Notice of Dispute (&quot;Notice&quot;). The Notice to AT&amp;T should be addressed to: General Counsel, AT&amp;T, 1025 Lenox Park Blvd., Atlanta, GA 30319 (&quot;Notice Address&quot;). The Notice must (a) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) set forth the specific relief sought (&quot;Demand&quot;). If AT&amp;T and You do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received, You or AT&amp;T may commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount of any settlement offer made by AT&amp;T or You shall not be disclosed to the arbitrator until after the arbitrator determines the amount, if any, to which You or AT&amp;T is entitled. You may download or copy a form Notice and a form to initiate arbitration at <a href="http://www.att.com/arbitration-forms">att.com/arbitration-forms</a>.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">3) After AT&amp;T receives notice at the Notice Address that You have commenced arbitration, it will promptly reimburse You for Your payment of the filing fee, unless Your claim is for greater than $75,000. (The filing fee currently is $125 for claims under $10,000 but is subject to change by the arbitration provider. If You are unable to pay this fee, AT&amp;T will pay it directly upon receiving a written request at the Notice Address.) The arbitration will be governed by the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) of the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;), as modified by these License Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules are available online at <a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a>, by calling the AAA at 1-800-778-7879, or by writing to the Notice Address. (You may obtain information that is designed for non-lawyers about the arbitration process at <a href="http://att.com/arbitration-information">http://att.com/arbitration-information</a>.) The arbitrator is bound by these License Terms. All issues are for the arbitrator to decide, except that issues relating to the scope and enforceability of the arbitration provision are for the court to decide. Unless AT&amp;T and You agree otherwise, any arbitration hearings will take place in the county (or parish) of Your billing address. If Your claim is for $10,000 or less, we agree that You may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted solely on the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator, through a telephonic hearing, or by an in-person hearing as established by the AAA Rules. If Your claim exceeds $10,000, the right to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted, the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the award is based. Except as otherwise provided for herein, AT&amp;T will pay all AAA filing, administration, and arbitrator fees for any arbitration initiated in accordance with the notice requirements above. If, however, the arbitrator finds that either the substance of Your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then the payment of all such fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In such case, You agree to reimburse AT&amp;T for all monies previously disbursed by it that are otherwise Your obligation to pay under the AAA Rules. In addition, if You initiate an arbitration in which You seek more than $75,000 in damages, the payment of these fees will be governed by the AAA rules.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">4) If, after finding in Your favor in any respect on the merits of Your claim, the arbitrator issues You an award that is greater than the value of AT&amp;T&#39;s last written settlement offer made before an arbitrator was selected, then AT&amp;T will:</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay You the amount of the award or $10,000 (&quot;the alternative payment&quot;), whichever is greater; and</span></p>
        <p style="margin-left:41.75pt;">
            <span style="font-size:12px;">&middot;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; pay Your attorney, if any, twice the amount of attorneys&#39; fees, and reimburse any expenses (including expert witness fees and costs) that Your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating, preparing, and pursuing Your claim in arbitration (&quot;the attorney premium&quot;).</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">If AT&amp;T did not make a written offer to settle the dispute before an arbitrator was selected, You and Your attorney will be entitled to receive the alternative payment and the attorney premium, respectively, if the arbitrator awards You any relief on the merits. The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees, expenses, and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator&#39;s ruling on the merits.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">5) The right to attorneys&#39; fees and expenses discussed in paragraph 23.1.4 above supplements any right to attorneys&#39; fees and expenses You may have under applicable law. Thus, if You would be entitled to a larger amount under the applicable law, this provision does not preclude the arbitrator from awarding You that amount. However, You may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys&#39; fees or costs. Although under some laws AT&amp;T may have a right to an award of attorneys&#39; fees and expenses if it prevails in an arbitration, AT&amp;T agrees that it will not seek such an award.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">6) The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party&#39;s individual claim. <strong>YOU AND AT&amp;T AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING.</strong> Further, unless both You and AT&amp;T agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void.</span></p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-size:12px;">7) Notwithstanding any provision in these License Terms to the contrary, we agree that if AT&amp;T makes any future change to this arbitration provision (other than a change to the Notice Address) while these License Terms are in effect, You may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above. By rejecting any future change, You are agreeing that You will arbitrate any dispute between us in accordance with the language of this provision.</span></p>
