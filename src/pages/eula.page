<p class="MsoNormal">
    You acknowledge and understand that number porting depends on the cooperation of third parties outside of

   informed that You will be required to provide such detailed and specific information to complete a port request. 
   For porting numbers into Your RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T Account, follow the procedures on Your Account 
   settings page for transferring a number to Your RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T Account. For porting numbers out
    of Your RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T Account, follow the procedures of Your new service provider.
     You understand that porting Your number out of Your Account does not automatically terminate Your RingCentral
      Office@Hand from AT&amp;T Account.

     16.<span style="font-size: 7pt; "></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additional Terms for RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T Service with VoIP
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
   RingCentral plans include one or more Voice over Internet Protocol (“VoIP”) lines and options 
   to add one or more VoIP lines to Your Services. In either case, Services for the VoIP line(s)
   will be referred to as “VoIP Service”, for which the following additional terms shall apply:
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Grant of Rights</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
     RingCentral grants You a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license, and
     right to use each VoIP line exclusively with one user under Your Account, subject to 
     all the other terms of this Agreement. Accordingly, if You want to allow multiple users to use the 
     VoIP Service, You will need to purchase at least one VoIP line for each user.
</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Equipment</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
     To use the VoIP Service, You may need to purchase phones, headsets, or other equipment (collectively, “Equipment”). 
     All Equipment shipments are F.O.B. RingCentral’s shipping distributor facility. RingCentral’s liability for delivery 
     shall cease, and title to such Equipment (if applicable) and all risk of loss or damage
     shall pass to You upon delivery to the shipping carrier.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    All equipment obtained from RingCentral in connection with VoIP Service is subject to the Equipment Return Policy above. 
 </p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>911 SERVICE FOR RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>YOU UNDERSTAND THAT 911 SERVICE IS ONLY PROVIDED BY RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T IP 
    DESK PHONES AND SOFTPHONES ON PCS, AND THE OTHER RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND
     SERVICES DO NOT PROVIDE 911 SERVICE.</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
      911 service for RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE operates differently than traditional 911 
      service. We are required by the FCC to advise You of the circumstances under which 911 may not be 
      available or may be in some way limited by comparison to traditional 911 service. Such circumstances 
      include
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>(1)&nbsp;Internet Connection Failure.</b>
     If the connection to the wired broadband Internet over which Your 
     RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE is provided is interrupted, 
     You will not have access to RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE during that interruption and 
     therefore will not have access to 911 service during that interruption.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>(2)&nbsp;Number Flexibility &amp; Service Portability.</b>
      Traditional 911 service automatically sends Your 911 call to the appropriate local 
      emergency responder, or Public Safety Answering Point ("PSAP"), based on Your wireline
       telephone number. Enhanced 911 service (also known as E911) automatically sends Your 911 
       call to the appropriate PSAP along with Your registered address and telephone number.
        Because RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE permits You to obtain a telephone 
        number that does not correspond to Your geographic location
         (for example, You may obtain a RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE phone number with a California
          area code even if You do not have a California address) and allows You to use RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T
           SERVICE anywhere You have wired broadband Internet, 911 service for RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE 
           functions differently than traditional 911 and E911 service in certain respects.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Because Your address does not necessarily correspond with Your telephone number, You must provide RingCentral with
     the street address(es) where You will be using RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE ("Registered Location(s)") 
     when You sign up for service.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    If You relocate any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, or ATA with traditional phone) that 
    You use to access the RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE, You must update Your Registered Location(s). 
    If You do not update Your Registered Location(s), any 911 calls You make using RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND 
    FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE will be routed based on Your previously provided Registered Location and therefore may not be 
    routed to the appropriate PSAP for Your new location.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    In addition, because RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE will, where possible, automatically 
    transmit Your Registered Location to the PSAP, You must update Your Registered Location to ensure that 
    RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE transmits accurate location information to the PSAP.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Once You notify us of a change in Your Registered Location, there may be a delay in making the new 
    Registered Location available to properly route 911 calls and advise PSAPs of Your new Registered Location.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    In some parts of the country where direct routing to PSAPs is not available for 911 service for 
    RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T , RingCentral will route Your call to the National Emergency 
    Call Center where trained agents will ask for the name, location, and telephone number of the person 
    calling 911 and will contact the appropriate PSAP to send help. The call center will not automatically 
    receive Your address and telephone number. In these situations, public safety response times may be delayed.
     As a result, there may be an additional delay before emergency services arrive.
</p>
<p  class="MsoNormal">
    <b>(3)&nbsp;Loss of Electrical Power.</b>Unless You have a backup system to power Your wired broadband 
     Internet connection and any equipment (PC with softphone, IP phone, ATA with traditional phone)
     that You use to access Your RINGCENTRAL OFFICE@HAND FROM AT&amp;T SERVICE, You will not have phone 
     service or 911 service during any power outage.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Registration of Physical Locations Required.</b> 
    As discussed above, You must register the Registered Location where You will be using service for each 
    Premium user You sign up for from RingCentral (e.g., if You purchase RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T for 
    three Premium users, You must provide a Registered Location for each of the three users). RingCentral will 
    obtain Your Registered Location as part of the service initiation process and will not provide Service until 
    you have provided Your initial Registered Location. However, You must update Your Registered Location when You
     use Your Service from a new location. Regardless of what address You register, in some circumstances, such as 
     unavailability of direct routing to PSAPs or the use of portable devices to access the VoIP Service, emergency 
     calls will be routed to the National Emergency Call Center.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    You agree to provide true, accurate, current, and complete Registered Location information to RingCentral
     as part of the service initiation process and to update as soon as possible Your Registered Location with true, 
     accurate, current, and complete information whenever You use Your Service from a new location. If You provide
      Registered Location information that is, or that RingCentral suspects to be, false, inaccurate, not current,
       or incomplete, RingCentral has the right to suspend or terminate the Services and refuse any and all current 
       or future use of all Services, or any portion thereof. RingCentral will not, however, disable Your ability to
        make a 911 call during any service suspension.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    You may update Your Registered Location by logging on to Your Account settings page or calling customer 
    support at AT&amp;T Advanced Mobility Solutions customer care at 1-866-563-4703. For purposes of 911 Dialing, 
    You may only register one Registered Location for each Premium user.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Notify All Users of 911 Limitations.</b> . You should inform all business colleagues, household residents, guests, and other persons who may be present at the physical location where You utilize the Service that 911 may not be available or may be in some way limited in comparison to traditional 911 service. RingCentral will provide these subscribers stickers warning that "E911 Service May Be Limited or Not Available" (or a similar message) for use with any VoIP equipment by mailing stickers to subscribers upon Service initiation. It is Your responsibility to place these stickers on the equipment You use to access VoIP Service. If You have not received a sticker, or You require additional 911 stickers, please contact AT&amp;T customer support at AT&amp;T Advanced Mobility Solutions customer care at 1-866-563-4703.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Disclaimer of 911 Liability.</b> RingCentral disclaims all responsibility for the conduct of PSAPs, 
    the National Emergency Call Center, and all other third parties involved in the provision of emergency
     response services. RingCentral does not have any control over PSAPs, the National Emergency Call Center,
      or other third parties and is therefore not responsible for whether they answer 911 calls made using the
       VoIP service, how they answer these calls, or how they handle or respond to these calls. RingCentral relies
        on third parties to assist it in the provision of 911 service and disclaims any and all liability for acts
         or omissions by third parties in the provision of 911 service for RingCentral Office@Hand from AT&amp;T.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>Operator Assisted Calling, 311, 511, and other X11 Calling</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    The VoIP Service does not support 0+ or operator assisted calling (including, without limitation, collect calls, third party billing calls, 900, or calling card calls). The Service may not support 311, 411, 511, and/or other X11 calling (other than 911 and 711 as specified in this Agreement) in one or more service areas.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    <b>711 Calling</b>
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    The VoIP Service allows You to dial 711 to reach Telecommunications Relay Services ("TRS"). TRS enables persons with hearing or speech disabilities to access the public telephone system and communicate with voice telephone users through a communications assistant at a TRS relay center. Because the Service allows You to use a phone number that may not reflect Your geographic location, 711 calls made using the VoIP Service may not be routed to the appropriate TRS center for Your geographic location.

      information. You agree that RingCentral is under no obligation to have Your Listing Information 
      removed from any third-party directory assistance listing service already in receipt of such information.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
      RingCentral bears no responsibility or liability for any cost, damages,
      liabilities, or inconvenience caused by calls made to Your telephone number;
      materials sent to You; inaccuracies, errors, or omissions with Listing Information; 
      or any other use of such information.

     33.<span style="font-size: 7pt; "></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dispute Resolution and Optional Arbitration
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    In the event of any dispute, claim, question, or disagreement between You and RingCentral ("Dispute"), You and RingCentral shall first use reasonable best efforts to settle the dispute, claim, question, or disagreement. To this end, You and an authorized member of RingCentral's legal department (or other representative of RingCentral designated by the legal department) shall consult and negotiate with each other in good faith and, recognizing their mutual interests, attempt to reach a just and equitable solution satisfactory to both parties. Neither You nor RingCentral shall file or pursue any Disputes in any court, administrative, arbitral, or other adjudicative body prior to engaging in such consultations and negotiations.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    You agree that any Disputes shall be adjudicated in the state and federal courts of the State of California, U.S.A. Venue for any Disputes shall be the Superior Court of California, County of San Mateo for state court cases, and the United States District Court of the Northern District of California for federal court cases. You agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts with respect to any Disputes and agree not to bring any Disputes in any other court or adjudicative body. You hereby consent to venue and personal jurisdiction in such courts with respect to such Disputes and irrevocably waive any right that You may have to assert that such forum is not convenient or that any such court lacks jurisdiction.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    Notwithstanding the adjudication requirement above, for any Disputes involving ten thousand dollars ($10,000) or less, either party may choose to resolve such Dispute through binding, non-appearance-based arbitration (i.e., arbitration conducted online, through written filings, and/or via teleconference). Such arbitration shall be conducted through an established alternative dispute resolution provider mutually agreed upon by the parties, and any judgment rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. The arbitrator's decision shall be final and legally binding.
</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">
    In the event of any litigation (including arbitration) between You and RingCentral, the non-prevailing party shall reimburse the prevailing party for all reasonable and documented attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses relating to the Dispute.
